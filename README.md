# peerio

A dApp that allows people to submit, read and review scholarly articles.

Users subscribe to peerio and are then allowed to access the collection of articles on the data DAO. They are also given the ability to upload their own articles to then be peer reviewed by other members of the data DAO (subscribers). Articles are only accepted into the collection when they pass the peer review as a form of consensus. Reputation can also be earned by reviewing an article and getting an article approved. Not providing an accurate review or receiving negative reviews will decrease reputation.

The process of peer-reviewing reduces:
- Plagiarism
- Limited and small review groups
- Lack of input from other reseachers working on related topic
- Unnecessary duplication of efforts
- A need for others to validate and replicate findings
